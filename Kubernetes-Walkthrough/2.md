# Deploying to Kubernetes

Once that you have verified your installation of kubernetes, the next step is to
deploy an app to that cluster. To download the source code needed, clone this specific branch with

```
git clone -b kubernetes --single-branch https://github.com/Appdynamics/AD-Capital-Docker.git
```

Ensure that the correct files were downloaded. You should see a a few folders, but the most important
is that the Kubernetes folder is there. All of the appdynamics agent configuration variables need to be set in the
env-configmap.yaml. Fill in your controller variables in that file. Once you have done that you need to put in the customer name and accesskey in your secret.yaml file. These values need to be base64 encoded. At the terminal type
```
echo -n <yournumberhere> | base64
```

 That command will give you the base64 encoded version of your value. Those agent variables are being consumed in the deployments for approval, rest, processor, portal, verification and the daemon set monitor.

Deploying is extremely easy. Just run the command below (make sure kubectl is talking to your cluster)

```
kubectl create -f Kubernetes/ --validate=false
```

In return you should be able to see all of the individual pods, deployments, services etc create like below.

You should then be able to validate everything via the Kubernetes UI Dashboard and the appdynamics product. If you haven't set up transaction analytics for this application.


See [here](https://github.com/Appdynamics/AD-Capital-Docker/blob/master/ADCapital-Walkthrough/5.md) for steps on how to configure transaction analytics for this application.
